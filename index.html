        <h1>My Poems</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>I love writing poems of different kinds I have written poems on - Climbing a tree, my shadow and The sky.My favorite poem is Climbing a tree as it was my first poem I have written. Writing poems is just like expressing your feelings on what you think, In my school I have won the 1st prize on reciting a poem. In a poem I like writing ryming words it makes the poem feel more interesting and good. I always try to make poem of more than 2 paragraphs it takes me more than an hour to complete writing 1 single poem. my this special hobby was created when in my school the students had to make their own poem and recite it as beutifully as they can, the student who recites the poem very nicely he/she will win a prize! I had won the 1st prize and since than writing poem became my hobby!!!
